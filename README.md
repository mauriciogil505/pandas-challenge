# Pandas-challenge
## Summary
Summary
For this project, the Python Pandas module will be used to analyze data from a few csv files on student performance in schools. 

## Analysis Goals
The objective is gain insights into the data stored in the csv files by use of pandas dataframes code to classify and summarize several performance data, including average scores, passing rates, and overall school performance depending on school size and type.

The script calculates the following values:

The per-student budget for each school.
Average math and reading scores for each school.
The percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
A breakdown of school performance based on school size.
A breakdown of school performance based on school type.

## Instrucions 
git clone Git Respository into your local terminal
This assignment uses Jupyter notebook, so you can launch jupyter notebook from your terminal

The datasets includes details on different schools, such as their sizes, finances, and math and reading test scores for their pupils.

## Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local terminal:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-data-analysis.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
Open the terminal and navigate to your project directory:

cd into your file on your machine
3. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the required packages if needed:

conda activate dev

Launch jupyter notebook

Write script in main jupyter file
